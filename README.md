# Sass: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets

# Sass Definition

Sass is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).


## The steps that you will need to follow while using SASS.

1. Firstly, download and install ruby if not installed. click this link to download ruby: https://rubyinstaller.org/ 
2. Install sass on your local machine.
3. Create a project folder that includes a folder called "scss".
```
    - Bass Folder structure:
    - css
    - scss 
    - images
    - index.html
```
4. To install Ruby Sass, run the command "gem install sass".  
5. Once you have installed Ruby, run command "sass --watch scss:css" 

    (this command will link your scss folder and your css folder so that it will sinc)

6. Once the commands are completed, you will be able to work in your scss folder only. 

    Your command line will provide you with updates when you apply any changes using the scss file.


# Sass Partials

## Particals definition

```
You can create partial Sass files that contain little snippets of CSS that you can include in other Sass files. This is a great way to modularize your CSS and help keep things easier to maintain. A partial is simply a Sass file named with a leading underscore. You might name it something like _partial.scss. The underscore lets Sass know that the file is only a partial file and that it should not be generated into a CSS file. Sass partials are used with the @import directive.
```
